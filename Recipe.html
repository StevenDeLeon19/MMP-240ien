<h2>Toasted Coconut Rice Salad</h2>  
</header>
<main>
<p>
    Fluffy toasted rice meets crunchy slaw in this gingery, tofu-topped salad. 
    Jasmine rice gets toasted until fragrant and lightly golden, then it’s cooked with coconut milk to yield a supremely nutty base for the salad.  
    Lacing the rice with fresh ginger ensures that gingery warmth is carried through each bite. 
    Toasting the rice deepens the flavor and helps the grains stay separate once cooked. 
    The toasted grains also absorb the punchy dressing while maintaining their texture, meaning no soggy salad here. 
    Crunchy cabbage and a hefty helping of scallions, cilantro and buttery cashews bring welcome texture while quickly seared tofu transforms the salad into a full meal.
